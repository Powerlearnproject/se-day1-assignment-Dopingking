Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
Importance of Software in the technology industry are:
1. Creation of software application and system
2. Ensures software quality, efficiency, and security.
3.Enables large-scale project development and management.
4.Reduces development costs and risks through structured methodologies.
5.Facilitates innovation by providing robust and maintainable systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer:
1.Development of Programming languages (Fortran, c)
2.Advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3.Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
1.Requirement – Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
2.Design – Create system architecture, UI/UX design, and technical specifications.
3.Implementation  – Write and integrate code based on the design.
4.Testing – Perform unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
5.Deployment – Release the software to users or production.
5.Maintenance & Updates – Address bugs, optimize performance, and add new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
Feature	                                  Waterfall	                                                              Agile
Approach	                            Sequential & structured	                                               Iterative & flexible
Changes	                    Difficult to accommodate changes once development starts	                     Easily adaptable to changes
Project Type	                Suitable for projects with clear, fixed requirements	                      Best for projects requiring flexibility and collaboration
Example Use Case      	Government or banking systems requiring detailed documentation	                   Startups or software requiring frequent updates

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Answer:
Software Developer – Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions, tests, and maintains code. 
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software meets quality standards through testing and automation.
Project Manager (PM) – Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Help developers write, debug, and test code efficiently (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
Bug Fixing & Debugging – Use logging, debugging tools, and automated testing.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Answer:
    Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
    Integration Testing:  Ensures different modules work together..
    System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
    Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Answer:
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting well-structured inputs to interact effectively with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about software engineering."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain software engineering, its key principles, and its role in modern technology. Provide examples of software engineering methodologies and their real-world applications."

Reason the Improved Prompt is Better:

Clearer: Specifies what aspects to cover.
More Specific: Requests methodologies and applications.
Concise Yet Detailed: Ensures a well-structured response.
